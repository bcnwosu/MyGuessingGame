# MyGuessingGame
This is my source code for a guessing game where the user will guess a number that the computer chooses at random. The user will continue to guess until they arrive at the number chosen by the computer.
   I wrote the code for this file on Eclipse and imported the Scanner class to allow the console to receive the user's input. 

My Guessing Game is written in a way where the user will guess a number; and if the number is wrong, it will print " "guess" is wrong, Try again"
And if the number is correct then it will print " "guess" is correct" and then it will ask the user if they want to play again.

This is a simple guessing game that was written for fun and just to test out code.
